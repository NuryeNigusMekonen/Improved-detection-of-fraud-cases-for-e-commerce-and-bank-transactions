#  Improved Detection of Fraud Cases for E-Commerce and Bank Transactions

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on building reliable fraud detection models using advanced feature engineering, balancing techniques, and explainability tools.
We worked on two datasets:

* **E-Commerce Transactions (Fraud Data)**
* **Credit Card Transactions (Bank Data)**

Our goals were:

* Improve detection of fraudulent transactions
* Build interpretable models with SHAP explanations
* Compare model performance on different datasets

##  Key Components

###  Data Preprocessing

* Cleaned numerical & categorical features
* Feature engineering (e.g., time since signup, transaction counts)
* Balancing with **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance

---

###  Model Training

* Random Forest Classifier with tuned hyperparameters
* Separate models for Fraud Data and Credit Card Data
* Performance Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**

###  Model Explainability

* **SHAP (SHapley Additive ExPlanations)** for feature importance
* Global analysis with Beeswarm plots
* Local instance analysis with Waterfall plots

##  Performance Summary

| Dataset     | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Fraud Data  | \~87%    | \~92%     | \~79%  | \~86%    |
| Credit Card | \~99%    | \~90%     | \~82%  | \~86%    |

##  Insights & Outcomes

* Class imbalance strongly affects fraud detection; balancing improves recall
* SHAP helped uncover key features (e.g., `purchase_value`, `V17`) influencing fraud risk
* E-Commerce fraud is harder to predict than credit card fraud due to noisier data
